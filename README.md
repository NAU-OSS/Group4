## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

To contribute to this project, you will need the python 3.6 version. The use of other versions can result in different syntax requirments and may lead to the code not being compatible with what is already working. It is recomennded that you program in PyCharm from the company JetBrains. Another solution is to use IDLE with Python 3.6 but it is a simplistic system. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

For IDLE: 
The IDLE setup is extremely easy. IDLE is automatically downloaded when you install python. 
1. Go to python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/] or Google Python and the link is Download Python
2. Click on the link corresponding to version 3.6 
3. Allow the file to download then start installation process.
4. After installation, you can find IDLE by typing IDLE into the search bar. 
5. Open IDLE for coding. 

For PyCharm
1. Ensure you have Python already downloaded (instructions above)
2. Go to [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows]
3. Download the community version, which is free and open source
4. Run the installer and open program when install is complete. 
5. Open files that you will be working on. 
6. If no interpreter is configured PyCharm will tell you by a display bar at the top of the code. Click on link that says 
    "Configure Python Interpeter"
7. On the display that pops up find the python version installed in the drop down box and select apply. 
Environment is all set up
